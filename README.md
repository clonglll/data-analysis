Data Analysis
===
Here're some examples of data analystics. 
# problems including:
* prediction (credit default, energy star, house price, black friday)
* time series (stock_rnn, stock_cnn)
* recommander system(movie recommander)

# data preprocessing:
* fill NaN with different ways
* onehotEncoder
* cut down the storage of datasets, making them more efficient
* adjust the types of your data to fit problems
* other skills 

# feature engineering:
* find important features to target
* drop unnecessary features (indifferent collinear)
* form new efficient features(based on experience, based on algorithms)
* dimensionality reduction

# mainly used models:
* random forest, xgboost, cnn, rnn

# model evaluation:
* find proper parameters with gridsearchCV
* stack different models
